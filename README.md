# Weather Now

This app was created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The application allows user to find out the weather in a specific location at the current time.

Data is taken from [Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) using REST API technology.

Here's the [demo](https://redhatdevn16.github.io/react-weather-app/).
